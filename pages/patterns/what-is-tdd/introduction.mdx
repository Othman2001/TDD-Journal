# Test Driven Development

TDD is software development methdology in which tests are written to lead the system development. 
It was rotted in extereme programming and introduced for the first time by
  <b>Kent Beck</b>: and he discussed it in his famous book <b> Test-Driven Development: By Examples</b>

<b>Kent introduced two rules in his book:</b>

<Callout type="green">
1. Don't write any new code until you first have a test fails
2. Elimnate dublication
</Callout>

TDD is all about <b> Feedback </b>, TDD aims for shorter feedback cycle which means breaking the feature or task to smaller sub tasks every subtask should be tested solely.

How to reach for shorter TDD Cycle:
1. break the Feature for smaller sub tasks
2. write code 
3. test your code 
4. refactor 
5. test your code again 
6. go to next subtask
 

TDD is normally introduced as writing test before code, but do you ever asked yourself why it always introudced in that way ? 
Simply because TDD is about isolationg the code from test, so instead of testing your code you will foucs on testing the functionality and testing the system in the way the user will use it.
